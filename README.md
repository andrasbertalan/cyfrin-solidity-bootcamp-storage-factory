# cyfrin-solidity-bootcamp-storage-factory
Solidity smart contract learning projects from the Cyfrin Solidity Bootcamp – Storage Factory section (Section 2), including contract deployment examples and personal learning milestones.

Cyfrin Solidity Bootcamp – Section 2: Storage Factory
This repository contains my solutions, study notes, and example code from Section 2 ("Storage Factory") of the Cyfrin Solidity Smart Contract Bootcamp.
The goal of this section is to understand and implement contract composability, factory patterns, contract inheritance, and ABI interactions in Solidity.

Contents
contracts/StorageFactory.sol – Storage Factory contract deploying multiple SimpleStorage contracts and interacting with them.

contracts/SimpleStorage.sol – Basic storage contract with CRUD operations and struct/mapping examples.

Section notes and code snippets for all lessons:

Storage Factory Introduction

Setting Up The Project

Deploying a Contract From a Contract

Solidity Imports

Use AI to Help (pt.1)

Interacting With Contracts ABI

Inheritance in Solidity

Quiz & Section Recap

Key Learnings
Using smart contract factories to deploy and manage other contracts.

Importing and organizing Solidity files efficiently.

Calling functions on other contracts using address and ABI.

Leveraging inheritance to extend smart contract functionality.

Utilizing AI assistants to support Solidity learning.

Getting Started
Clone this repo.

Open the contracts in Remix or your preferred framework.

Deploy StorageFactory and interact with the deployed SimpleStorage contracts.

Feel free to review the included notes and my personal progress.

Purpose
This repo documents my learning milestones as a Solidity developer.
It can serve as a code reference for beginners or as a showcase of my progress for potential collaborators and employers.

Based on Cyfrin Solidity Bootcamp – Section 2 curriculum.

Ha szeretnéd, átdolgozom rövidítő, vagy részletesebb verzióra, illetve hozzáadhatok példákat, “how to run” vagy “resources” szekciót is.
